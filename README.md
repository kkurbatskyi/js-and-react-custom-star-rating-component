I have completed Q1 in Python and Q2 in JavaScript (with and without React)

q1-python folder contains a single main.py file that has a solution to Q1. In real world scenario I would have created a separate data-structure (an iterable dictionary) for simpler caching to be able to reuse it for other cases as well. For this Question I have decided to go with a simpler, "less wordy" solution.

Q2JS folder contains three other folders. It was not quite clear to me by the requirements if I am allowed to use JS libraries and Frameworks like ReactJS. So I have decided to complete it three times: in vanilla JS, using React only for the rating component, and writing a complete React App. They are in folders q2-vanilla-js, q2-minimum-react, and q2-all-react respectively. 
More details about these three folders are inside the README in Q2JS folder.
