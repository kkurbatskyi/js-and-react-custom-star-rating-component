# Screening Questions for Picovoice

I have completed **Q1 in Python** and **Q2 in JavaScript** (with and without React)

_**q1-python**_ folder contains a single `main.py` file that has a solution to **Q1**. In real world scenario I would have created a separate data-structure (an iterable dictionary) for simpler data-manipulation and to be able to reuse it for caching in other cases as well. For this Question I have decided to go with a simpler, "less wordy" solution.

**_Q2JS_** folder contains three other folders. It was not quite clear to me by the requirements if I am allowed to use JS libraries and Frameworks like ReactJS. So I have decided to complete it three times: in vanilla JS, using React only for the rating component, and writing a complete React App. They are in folders `q2-vanilla-js`, `q2-minimum-react`, and `q2-all-react` respectively. 
More details about these three folders are inside the `README` in **_Q2JS_** folder.
